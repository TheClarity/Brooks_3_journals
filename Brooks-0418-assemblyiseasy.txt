For what computational reason did you type elf64?
that's the operating system.
Why did you use ld?
it invokes the linker
Why did you not have to use chmod to make sample executable?

What problem did you have to solve to get it to work?
you had to increase the bumber of bytes
Given your actual experience with Assembly now --- Is assembly 'quick and easy'? Why or why not?
no, it is alot more code to do the simplest little things
What does 'low level' actually mean with regards to programming languages?
It's alot closer to what the computer code is actually reading.
