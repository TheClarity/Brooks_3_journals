So far it may not look like I am almost done but that is due to the fact that
I decided to learn about each of the polygons first but know that I know how 
they work I can easily put them in my art. So far im only using simple shapes
 with no animation, like triangles and squares but I hope to add little 
animations soon. I loooked at the sample code to help give me an idea of how 
to make and use methods and certain shapes. 

private vod drawRedSquare(GraphicsContext gc){
	gc.setFill(color.RED);
	gc.strokeLine(x1, y1, x2, y2);
}
