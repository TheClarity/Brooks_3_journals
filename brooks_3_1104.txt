A method is like a mini program. The method can be called upon to do what the
 method is programmed to do.

I used one method, it was the actyal part of the game, it made the game set 
a random number and allowed the player to play or guess numbers

A while loop is basically a for loop but through bolean, it will run as long as
it is true

I used the while loop to keep the game going, boolean was used to run the while
loop, the boolean remained true aslong as the counter was above 0.
